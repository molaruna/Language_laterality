# Language_laterality

This code uses FSL and SPM's laterality index (LI) toolbox to build a framework that quantifies Language laterality for a diverse group of pre-operative patients using fMRI language tasks. The abstract associated with this work is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v9avWW8kqCPBRDnGgXQaFJaE9HlT95C3/view?usp=sharing), upon request. 
  
## Getting Started

This code uses Matlab 2019b, R 4.0, and bash shell scripting. 

## Data

Data collected using clinical PACs is available on UCSF Box: [link](https://ucsf.box.com/s/0tlqrnsotvdj1rrqlofkg1sexwqw5zvz). You will first need to request access from me. Upload both datasets into the **data/inputs** directories to implement this code.
