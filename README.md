# Language_laterality

This code uses FSL and SPM's laterality index (LI) toolbox to build a framework that quantifies Language laterality for a diverse group of pre-operative patients using fMRI language tasks. The publication associated with this work is available [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00234-021-02685-z). 
  
## Getting Started

This code uses Matlab 2019b, R 4.0, and bash shell scripting. 

## Data

Data collected using clinical PACs is available on UCSF Box: [link](https://ucsf.box.com/s/0tlqrnsotvdj1rrqlofkg1sexwqw5zvz). You will first need to request access from me. Upload both datasets into the **data/inputs** directories to implement this code.
